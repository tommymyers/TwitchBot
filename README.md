# TwitchBot
Super rudimentary Twitch bot, built for no purpose other than for fun and to say that I've made a Twitch bot
## Prerequisites
 - [websocket_client](https://pypi.org/project/websocket_client/) package
 - File named **auth_token.py** with the bot account's OAuth token in a variable called *auth_token* (string)
 - Editing **config.json**:
	 - *nick*: bot account's username
	 - *join_channel*: which channel to join
